            Microsoft was the first to put AI on devices with its Copilot+ launch months ago. It caught Google and Apple sleeping and seemed poised to own the AI space with the help of OpenAI and ChatGPT.
            <br><br>
            However, Microsoft’s execution was so flawed that it isn’t clear if anyone is even using these Copilot+ features now. Recall is still being held back, and buyers are confused about what is or is not an AI PC, given there are no desktop AI PCs, gaming AI PCs, or workstation AI PCs in the market or on the near-term horizon.
            <br><br>
            This has given both Apple and Google time to close the competitive gap. Apple announced its Apple Intelligence initiative in June and then rolled it out last week in a way that should have more general Apple users using desktop and smartphone AI than Windows users are. Google has also begun to roll out AI features, so both companies are taking advantage of Microsoft’s extremely poor execution.
            <br> <br>
            The big difference for Apple is that it has started offering AI experiences in Apple stores with 15-minute sessions so that Apple users and potential users can play with the technology and become more familiar with it. There is no similar effort from either Microsoft or Google.
            <br> <br>
            Let’s discuss how this is likely to benefit Apple and its users during this AI rollout. We’ll then close with my Product of the Week, my new favorite phone: the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which I now carry daily.
